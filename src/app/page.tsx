                Hello! I am Warren Fernandez, a dedicated mathematics tutor with a deep-rooted passion for teaching. My educational journey began in San Francisco, where I attended Edison Elementary, followed by Ben Franklin Middle School and Jefferson High School in Daly City. I went on to earn my Masterâ€™s degree in Mathematics from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.

                Since 2000, I have been teaching high school mathematics at a K-12 school in the East Bay. I have also had the privilege of teaching at Cal State East Bay and the College of San Mateo. Throughout my career, I have been fortunate to achieve a 95% pass rate among my AP Calculus students on the AP exam. I have also been honored to serve as a graduation commencement speaker and received a yearbook dedication.

                Beyond my professional life, I am a husband and father who loves to travel and maintain an active lifestyle. My teaching philosophy is centered on making math accessible and enjoyable for all students. I have extensive experience working with students from diverse backgrounds and different learning styles, and I am passionate about helping each student reach their full potential.

                I am available to tutor Algebra 1 through AP Calculus, as well as standardized tests such as the ACT and SAT I/II. Tutoring sessions can be conducted via ZOOM or in person, depending on your preference. Whether you're struggling with basic concepts or aiming to master advanced topics, I am here to provide personalized guidance and support to help you succeed.
